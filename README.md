This task I completed for the Data Science Bootcamp introduces using functions to help with the efficiency of the code
Within this code we were asked to create functions for calculating the cost of plane tickets, a hotel stay and car rental.
Then we were required to put these 3 functions together within a whole new function. 
I was quite pleased with this code and tried to make it more efficient and adaptable for future needs by using dictionaries rather than if/elif statements as the Bootcamp had suggested to use. I received full marks on this task.
